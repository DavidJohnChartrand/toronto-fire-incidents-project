# Toronto Fire Incidents Project

## Description
### Analysing fire data created by the city of Toronto
Using the [city of Toronto's fire incident data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/fire-incidents/{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) to understand fires in [Toronto's neighbourhoods](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhoods/). This data with the use of the [fire station location](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/fire-station-locations/) and [fire hydrant location](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/fire-hydrants/) is used to improve our understanding of the nature of fire in the city.
